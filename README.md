## lcc.live

**Note:**  
- This is largely a hack and a playgroundâ€”proceed with caution ("here be dragons").  
- This version is not yet running in production.

**Overview:**

While this project might seem largely experimental, it's a fun place to explore different technologies and approaches. The goal is to provide [https://lcc.live/](https://lcc.live/), a site that quickly displays all the webcams I CARE ABOUT covering Little and Big Cottonwood Canyons.

**Current Status:**

- The current iteration is an experiment built using Go.
- Despite being somewhat rough around the edges, it performs exceptionally well.
- The codebase may be messy, but it's surprisingly approachable, especially for someone new to Go.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the project, but keep in mind that it's still a work in progress!
